### Read my sad story

This initial setup did not work because when I installed CUDA toolkit 10.1, my graphics driver for the 1060 card stopped working
I get an Error 43 in my driver. From my research, this seems to be related to a driver signing issue.

I spent 4 hours or so trying to remedy this situation to no avail (several safe mode restarts, using DDU, etc)

Need to fix my GPU driver...
